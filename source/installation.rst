Installation
============

Installing with pip
-------------------

``GPS2space`` will soon be available in PyPI and can be installed using ``pip install``

Installing from source
----------------------

You can install by cloning the GitHub repository, then use pip to install from where you store the cloned files:

.. code-block:: python

	git clone https://github.com/shuai-zhou/gps2space.git
	cd gps2space
	pip install .

	
You can also install directly from the GitHub repository:

.. code-block:: python

	pip install git+git://github.com/shuai-zhou/gps2space.git


..
  To show code block, one can use ".. literalinclude:: _example.py" without indent
  Then, use Four-Character as indent and ":lines: 1-3"
  This will only show the first 1-3 lines from your "_example.py"
